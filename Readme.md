## Prerequisites for Setting Up the Repository

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and extensions installed:

- **Node.js**: Required for running the project and managing dependencies.
- **CORS Configuration**: Allow CORS by enabling `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
- **Redux DevTools**: A browser extension for inspecting and debugging Redux state.
- **React Developer Tools**: A browser extension for inspecting React components and their state.
- **JSON Formatter**: A browser extension for formatting and viewing JSON data in a readable format.

# React Application Testing Setup

This guide provides the steps to configure and set up testing libraries in your React project. It includes setting up `Jest`, `React Testing Library`, and configuring `Babel` and `Parcel` for efficient testing.

## 1. Install Necessary Packages

### 1.1 Install React Testing Library and Jest

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react jest
```

### 1.2 Install Babel and Configure for Jest

If you're using `Babel`, you'll need to install additional dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Create a `babel.config.js` file in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ['@babel/preset-env', { targets: { node: 'current' } }],
    ['@babel/preset-react', { runtime: 'automatic' }] // This preset is for React JSX
  ]
};
```

### 1.3 Install JSDOM Environment

If you're using Jest version 28 or later, you'll need to install `jest-environment-jsdom`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom
```

### 1.4 Install React Testing Library Jest DOM

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom
```

### 1.5 Install Parcel (if you're using Parcel)

If you are using Parcel instead of Create React App, you'll need to configure Parcel for Jest:

1. Create a `.parcelrc` file in the root directory:

    ```json
    {
      "extends": "@parcel/config-default",
      "transformers": {
        "*.{js,mjs,jsx,cjs,ts,tsx}": [
          "@parcel/transformer-js",
          "@parcel/transformer-react-refresh-wrap"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

2. Disable the default Babel configuration by adding the above configuration.

## 2. Configure Jest

### 2.1 Initialize Jest Configuration

In the terminal, run the following command to initialize Jest:

```bash
npx jest --init
```

This will prompt you with a few questions. Answer them as follows:

- **TypeScript**: No
- **Test Environment**: jsdom (browser-like)
- **Add Coverage Reports**: Yes
- **Provider to use for code coverage**: Leave as default
- **Automatically clear mock calls and instances**: Yes

This will create a `jest.config.js` file with your chosen configurations.

## 3. Running Tests

### 3.1 Running Tests with Jest

Once everything is set up, you can run your tests using:

```bash
npm run test
```

### 3.2 Watch Mode

To keep Jest running in watch mode, add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "watch-test": "jest --watch"
}
```

Run the watch mode using:

```bash
npm run watch-test
```

## 4. Writing Test Cases

### 4.1 Example Unit Test

Create a test file inside the `__tests__` directory (e.g., `sum.test.js`):

```javascript
import { sum } from '../sum';

test('Sum function should calculate the sum of two numbers', () => {
  const result = sum(3, 2);
  expect(result).toBe(5);
});
```

### 4.2 Example React Component Test

To test a React component, create a test file (e.g., `Contact.test.js`):

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Contact from '../Contact';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';

test('Should load Contact component', () => {
  render(<Contact />);
  const heading = screen.getByRole('heading');
  expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 4.3 Mocking Fetch in Tests

If your component uses `fetch`, you can mock it in your test setup:

```javascript
global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
  Promise.resolve({
    json: () => Promise.resolve(mockData)
  })
);
```

## 5. Additional Configurations

### 5.1 Ignore Coverage Files

Add `/coverage` to your `.gitignore` to avoid pushing coverage reports to your repository:

```bash
echo '/coverage' >> .gitignore
```

## 6. Official Documentation

For more detailed information, check out the official documentation:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/languages/javascript/#babel)

```

This `README.md` file should help users set up their testing environment efficiently and guide them through writing and running their first tests in a React application.
